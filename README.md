## Solution Overview

### Components

1. **Magnetic Sensors**
    - **Type:** Hall Effect or Magneto-Resistive Sensors.
    - **Function:** Detect vehicle presence through changes in the magnetic field.
    - **Placement:** Embedded in the center of each parking space.
    - **Power:** Battery-powered or connected to solar panels for energy efficiency.

2. **Communication Protocols**
    - **LAN (Local Area Network):** Utilizes existing LAN infrastructure for data transmission from sensors to the central server.
    - **Microcontroller Units:** Interface sensors with the LAN.

3. **Central Server and Data Processing**
    - **Server:** Processes and stores data from sensors, providing real-time updates.
    - **Software:** Manages data processing, error handling, and user interface.

4. **Geofencing and Mobile Application**
    - **Geofencing:** Sends notifications to users as they enter predefined geofenced areas.
    - **Mobile App:** Displays real-time parking availability, navigation assistance, and payment options.

### How the System Works

1. **Installation of Magnetic Sensors:**
    - **Placement:** Sensors are embedded in the pavement of each parking space.
    - **Power Source:** These sensors can be battery-powered or connected to a low-voltage power supply.

2. **Data Transmission:**
    - **Communication Protocols:** Sensors will use LAN to send data.
    - **Data Hub:** A local gateway or hub will collect data from all sensors within the parking facility and transmit it to a central server.

3. **Central Server and Data Processing:**
    - **Real-Time Processing:** The central server processes the data to determine the occupancy status of each parking space in real-time.
    - **Database Management:** This information is stored in a database and updated continuously.

4. **Geofencing and Mobile Application:**
    - **Geofencing Setup:** Geofences are defined around parking areas and key entry points using GPS coordinates.
    - **User Interaction:** When a vehicle with our mobile app enters the geofenced area, the app receives real-time data from the central server about available parking spots.
    - **Notifications:** The app sends notifications to the user about nearby available parking spaces.

5. **User Experience:**
    - **Real-Time Updates:** Users receive real-time updates on parking availability as they approach or enter the geofenced area.
    - **Navigation Assistance:** The app provides navigation to the nearest available parking spot.
    - **Payment and Reservation:** Users can pay for parking and reserve spots in advance through the app.

### Workflow Summary

1. **Vehicle Enters Geofenced Area:**
    - The geofencing application on the user's mobile device detects entry into the geofenced area.

2. **Data Request and Notification:**
    - The app sends a request to the central server for real-time parking availability.
    - The server processes this request and sends the latest data back to the app.

3. **User Receives Information:**
    - The app displays available parking spaces to the user.
    - The user can navigate to the selected parking space, make a reservation, and complete payment through the app.

### Technical Implementation

1. **Sensor to Gateway Communication:**
    - **Protocol:** Use LAN for communication from sensors to the gateway.
    - **Gateway Placement:** Install gateways at strategic locations to ensure complete coverage of the parking facility.

2. **Gateway to Central Server Communication:**
    - **Internet Connectivity:** Gateways connect to the central server via the internet (Ethernet or Wi-Fi).

3. **Geofencing and Mobile App Integration:**
    - **Geofencing SDKs:** Use geofencing SDKs (like Google Geofencing API) within the mobile app to detect when a user enters a geofenced area.
    - **Backend Integration:** The mobile app communicates with the backend server via APIs to fetch real-time parking data.
    - **Real-Time Updates:** The server sends updates to the app, which then notifies the user.
